###### Overview of the analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to see the differences in temperature trends between the months of June and December where his location in Oahu is. The reason for this would be to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round. A quick note that the temperature of these figures below is done in Fahrenheit 

###### Results

Summary Statistics for June

- The highest temperature seen in June is 85 degrees
- The average temperature for the whole month is roughly 75 degrees 
- Overall these figures seem to suggest that this would be an ideal temperature for selling Ice Cream and planning towards.

Summary Statistics for December

- The highest temperature seen in December in Oahu is 83 degrees. Judging by this we can guess that temperatures do not trend wildly past the means of December and June
- The average temperature for the whole month is 71 degrees. Only a couple of percentage points shy of June's average. 
- Overall, judging by how similar the figures are between June and December, it is believable to assume that year-round temperatures for Oahu are quite consistent and do not deviate often. 

###### Summary

Overall as we can see, the temperatures do not deviate between the two months based on the data that was examined. This would prove vital to W. Avy as it helps get a good sense of how his Ice Cream business should have a great chance of being able to operate sustainably year round if these figures are to be followed. However, some more analyses that I would welcome would include a direct location where the shop will be located and whether or not through past data whether weather patterns are consistent or these figures only speak to a limited time scape. The direct location can help give us a good sense of whether or not the location is prone to being hotter or colder, judging by it being a Surf and Ice Cream shop, it is safe to assume W. Avy has it located by the shore which should help with foot traffic and relief from the sun for potential customers. Even more data would help identify if the temperatures we examined are consistent throughout multiple years or deviate/trend differently. More data would enable us to examine and see if either is the case.
